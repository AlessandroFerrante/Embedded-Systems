# Example: Automatic Gate
This example implements the control of an automatic gate system, using timers (TIM2 and TIM3) to manage the timing of gate operations and external interrupts (EXTI) to manage button presses to control the state transitions of the gate. The display shows the percentage of gate opening using a simple visual representation.
