# ADC
Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), converts analog signals into digital data. This allows microcontrollers to process real-world analog signals, such as temperature, pressure, and light intensity, while using the digital value for other functions.

### File
- The [`adc.c`](https://github.com/AlessandroFerrante/Embedded-Systems/blob/main/ADC/adc.c) file contains the implementation of the ADC functionalities for the STM32 microcontroller using the `stm32_unict_lib` library. It includes functions to initialize the ADC, start conversions, and read the converted digital values.

## Requirements
- Visual Studio Code with the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).
- `stm32_unict_lib` library provided by the university for the STM32 microcontroller.
